# 1. What is the book about as a whole?

Human ideals - how should the superhuman behave; what is beautiful and what is disdainful. The book tries to be a moral compass through the prism of Ayn Rand and 20th century capitalism vs socialism.

# 2. What is being said in detail, and how?

A person should be proud; a person should do whatever he believes is right for his own sake. Society is lead by people who act out of self-interest and society is pulled down by people who act in the interest of the common man. This is illustrated by the characters - Howard Roark is an idealized person who only thinks of himself and Toohey is someone who thinks individual is worthless. One is deeply happy, the other is unhappy.

# 3. Is the book true, in whole or part?

I disagree with the lesson of the book. It is mostly a personal reading on morality and there is no right or wrong way to view morality. But I don't agree with the lesson of the book as the characters and the story was not belieavable. To me it fails to illustrate the superiority of one ideal over the other because it is a grotesque representation that is scarcely grounded in reality.

# 4. What of it?

I'm glad I read some Ayn Rand so I can claim I have read her for boastful points.
