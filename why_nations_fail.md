# What is the book about as a whole?
'Why Nations Fail' dives into history and analyses a lot of nations to provide an explanation on growth or lack thereof.

# What is being said in detail, and how?
The book ties economical growth to political institutions. It makes the following notable claims that I will explain later:

## The first prerequisite to growth is political centralisation

This point is a bit more obvious so the authors don't spend as much time on it but they do provide examples of nations without centralisation and how 'failed' they are in comparison. 

## the second prerequisite to growth is inclusive (not extractive) political institutions
- political and economical inclusive vs extractive are coupled
## Extractive/inclusive . Extractive is defined as political entities are set up in a way to extract resources from the nation and subvert economical activity. Inclusive is defined as political entities are set up in a way to enable nations to have agency in economical activity.
- both paths of inclusive or extractive institutions are self-sustaining



The book re-iterates that growth under extractive institutions is possible but limited and would never match growth under inclusive institutions because of the following factors:
- the political elite 

# Is the book true, in whole or part?
The book appears to provide a sound theory. It uses a lot of examples from history and I failed to see counter-examples. There is some nuance - the claim that growth under extractive institutions is limited is not absolute as it is more akin to "eventually" limited so it could take several decades to be proven right, especially for popular counter-examples like today's China or Singapore.

The book does an amazing job at looking through a lot of nations but no book can ever go throgh all of history and of course there are curious counter-examples that the book doesn't explain. Notable one is the oil states of the Arabian peninsula - the book simply states that they are rich because of oil and doesn't expand on extractive/inclusive nuance there.

# What of it?
The implications are that nations should make a conscious effort towards more inclusive political and economical institutions
